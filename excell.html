                title: "Excell",
                problem: "During my internship, I was tasked to completely revamp a website for a solar power company. The original site doesn't standout as much compared to others, the company was doing great work in renewable energy, but their online presence felt dated and didn't really show off their products or their mission. I wanted the new design to feel as clean and innovative as the technology they provide. I focused on building a UI that wasn't just 'pretty' but one that functioned as a professional showcase for their hardware and their sustainability goals. By using a more modern layout and earthy, high-energy tones, I made sure the visuals finally matched the company’s actual value, making the importance of solar energy clear to every visitor.",
                process: "Focused on a 'tech-forward' aesthetic.",
                conclusion: "Finalist in the competition."
            },
            {
                title: "The Design Phase",
                problem: "",
                process: `I start by looking at the landscape. I researched similar websites to figure out what users expect and where current designs were missing the mark. This helped me take standard navigation patterns and rework them into a fresh interface that’s actually easy to move through. It wasn't about copying what's out there, but about learning from it to build something better.
                        <br><br>
                        For the visual side, I focused on creating a layout that felt balanced rather than cluttered. I spent a lot of time fine-tuning the color palette and typography to make sure they didn’t just look good, but actually fit the brand’s voice. I wanted the hierarchy to feel natural—so a user knows exactly where to look first without thinking about it. By treating every component as part of a larger, cohesive system, I was able to turn a dated site into a polished, modern experience that hits all the right UX points while keeping the visual identity sharp and intentional.`,
                conclusion: ""
            },
            {
                title: "Wrapping Up",
                problem: "",
                process: "",
                solution: `After gathering all my research and reference materials, I took a hard look at what was actually on the page to find the breaking points. It was clear that the biggest issue wasn't a lack of information, but a total lack of connection—the interface felt cold and frustrating to navigate. I used those "missing pieces" as my roadmap, focusing the design on removing the friction that was making the process feel like a chore.
                        <br><br>
                        Solving this was about more than just a fresh coat of paint; it was about fixing a real human problem. When an interface is clunky or uninspiring, people stop using it, which is a huge deal when you're dealing with something as important as speech progress or a company's mission. By identifying exactly what was lacking—like clear feedback loops and a visual flow that actually made sense—I was able to turn a frustrating experience into something that felt supportive and intuitive.`,
                conclusion: ""
            },
            {
                title: "Wrapping Up",
                problem: "",
                process: "",
                conclusion: `The core of this project was about taking a company with a powerful mission and giving them a digital identity to match. I started by digging into the competitive landscape, looking at how other solar platforms functioned so I could pinpoint exactly where the existing site was failing. It wasn't just about the dated look; the real issue was a total lack of connection. The interface felt cold and cluttered, making it hard for users to actually engage with the company’s products or their sustainability goals.
                <br>br>
                Once I identified these gaps, I used them as my roadmap. I focused on building a clean, modern layout with a color palette and typography that felt both professional and eco-conscious. My goal was to create a cohesive design system where every button and component felt like it belonged to the same family. By streamlining the navigation and fixing the "friction points" that were frustrating users, I turned a clunky information portal into a polished, high-performing brand experience.
                <br><br>
                This revamp taught me that great UI/UX design is really about solving human problems. It’s not just about making a site look "expensive"; it’s about removing the barriers between a company’s message and its audience. By focusing on a scalable design system and a user-first layout, I was able to create an interface that finally gets out of the user's way, allowing the company’s mission to take center stage.`
